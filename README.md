# TexasPopulation
Leaflet Lab

This site was created as a project for the Interactive Cartography & Geovisualization course at UW-Madison. I wanted to create an interactive map using Leaflet to display the rapid population growth taking place in Texas. The site allows the user to manipulate a temporal slider to view the population changes over 5-year increments.
